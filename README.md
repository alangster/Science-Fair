ScienceFair
============

ScienceFair offers researchers in all scientific disciplines to share their posters. It allows anyone to browse posters by subject or author and leave feedback or questions. Essentially, ScienceFair seeks to broaden the dialogue from from a traditional poster session, during which presentations last only a few minutes. ScienceFair provides researchers the opportunity to broaden the audience that sees their posters, without spending hundreds of dollars to travel to research conferences.
